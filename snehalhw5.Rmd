#Question set I
#What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated? --> there are 1852 chocolate bars rated.
nrow(choco)

#How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.-->as the years increase, the count does too except around 2016 and 2017
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Review.Date)) +
  geom_bar()

#Question set II

#1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.--> As you can see from the graph below, most are rated between 3 to 4. The data seems to be a little skewed to the left. The outliers are the ones that lie outside most of the other values which I think are 1 and 5.
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, fill = "dodgerblue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Chocolate Ratings") +
  xlab("Rating") +
  ylab("Count")

#2 Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar?--> The data is too scattered and has no pattern so no, ratings do not depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "dodgerblue") +
  ggtitle("Rating vs. Cocoa Percentage") +
  xlab("Cocoa Percentage") +
  ylab("Rating") 


#3 How do ratings compare across different company locations? Focus on the three locations with the most ratings: -->according to the graph, all three locations have the same median but Canada has more points in the upper quartile. France and the US both have outliers.

# Filter data to top 3 locations
top3 <- dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))

# Create a boxplot of Rating by Company.Location
ggplot(top3, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Rating)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Chocolate Ratings by Company Location") +
  xlab("Company Location") +
  ylab("Rating")


#Snehal's question

#Tara's question
#What is the relationship between company location and cocoa percentages?
ggplot(top3, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Company.Location)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Company Location by Cocoa Percentage") +
  xlab("Cocoa Percentage") +
  ylab("Rating")

#Aditi's question

#How do review dates compare across USA, France, and Canada? -->as you can see, Canada and the USA have the same median and France has the most review dates than the other two. 
ggplot(top3, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Review.Date)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue", color = "black") +
